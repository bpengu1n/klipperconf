# [bltouch]
# sensor_pin: ^PROBE_SENSOR
# # #   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. Most BLTouch devices
# # #   require a pullup on the sensor pin (prefix the pin name with "^").
# # #   This parameter must be provided.
# control_pin: PROBE_SERVO
# # #   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
# # #   provided.
# # #pin_move_time: 0.680
# # #   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to
# # #   move up or down. The default is 0.680 seconds.
# stow_on_each_sample: False
# # #   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
# # #   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
# # #   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
# # #   this to False. The default is True.
# #probe_with_touch_mode: True
# #   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
# #   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
# pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
# #   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
# #   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
# #   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
# #   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
# #pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
# #   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
# #   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
# #   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
# #   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
# #set_output_mode:
# #   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
# #   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
# #   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
# #   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
# #   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
# #   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
# x_offset: -47
# y_offset: -13
# speed: 50
# lift_speed: 50
# samples: 3
# #   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
# #   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
# #sample_retract_dist: 2mm
# samples_result: average
# #   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
# #   "median" or "average". The default is average.
# samples_tolerance: 0.040
# #   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
# #   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
# #   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
# #   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
# samples_tolerance_retries: 5
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#   See the "probe" section for information on these parameters.

#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines

#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines

#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be

#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
